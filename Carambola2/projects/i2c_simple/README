On Carambola2 run:

# insmod spi-gpio.k
# insmod spi-gpio-custom.ko bus1=1,18,19,20,0,4000000,23 # 4MHz is wrong, should be some other number
# insmod i2c-gpio-custom bus1=0,15,16 # be careful Carambola will not bootup if this pins are connected to WM8731, just have to unplug it and after boot is finished plug it again
